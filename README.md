# Client Server Implementation in OpenGL
This is a simple Client Server Implementation in C++ using OpenGL. This is a menu driven program which allows the user to understand where and what is happening in the background of a Client Server Model. This helps the user to see where exactly the packets are transferred, thus creating a simulation model. This was used to educate junior students on the basics on Client Server Communication.
